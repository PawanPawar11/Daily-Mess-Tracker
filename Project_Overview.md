# Scope:
Make a simple app called Daily Mess Tracker.

# Objective:
- Let people sign up / log in and use their own account.

- Inside the account, user can tick each date for mess attendance — max 2 times per day.

- Allow the user to add mess details: mess name, mess start date, how many plates (thalis) the mess has, and the amount for those plates.

- Track usage so the app can show how many mess days are left and how many plates (thalis) are left.

- Send a notification to the user 2 days before the mess ends.

- When the user doesn’t go to mess, let them enter a reason for skipping.

# Outcome:
Make it dead-simple to record daily mess usage, monitor remaining balance/days, and get a timely reminder before mess ends.

# Tech Stack:
Frontend: React + Vite

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Auth: JWT-based login/signup
